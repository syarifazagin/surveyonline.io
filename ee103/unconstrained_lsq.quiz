== Unconstrained Least-Squares
[]
In practical applications of least-squares polynomial fitting, it is always best to use the highest-order polynomial that is computationally feasible.
* True
*= False

Least-squares approximate solution of overdetermined equations
* is a method to find an exact solution of $Ax=y$ :: Ax=y may not have an exact solution
* is most useful when $A$ is square.
* is a method for computing $A^{−1}$ that avoids numerical instability.
*= is a method for finding a value of $x$ that minimizes $\|Ax−y\|$.

Suppose $y=Ax+v$, where $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is some set of parameters
you wish to estimate, $y \in \mathbb{R}^m$ is a set of measurements,
and $v$ represents a noise.
We assume $m>n$.
Consider an estimator of the form $\hat{x} = By$.
*= Choosing $B$ to be any left inverse of $A$ yields $\hat{x} = x$,
no matter what x is, provided $v=0$.
* The choice $B=(A^TA)^{−1}A^T$ yields $\hat{x}=x$, provided $v$ is small.
* The choice $B=(A^TA)^{−1}A^T$ yields $\hat{x}$ that is closest to $x$
*= The choice $B=(A^TA)^{−1}A^T$ yields $\hat{x}$ that minimizes
the norm of $Ax - y$.

[Least-Squares Data Fitting]
Least-squares function fitting works well for interpolation, but should never be used for extrapolation.
* True
*= False

Consider the image ||IMG:lsq_outlier.jpg||. If we do a least-squares
fit of a straight line to these points, will it be a good fit?
* Yes :: The fit looks like ||IMG:lsq_outlier_ans.jpg|| As we can see,
the outliers noticeably influence the slope of the fit.
*= No :: The fit looks like ||IMG:lsq_outlier_ans.jpg|| As we can see,
the outliers noticeably influence the slope of the fit.

[Regularization]
Regularized least-squares, i.e., choosing $x$ to minimize
$\|Ax−y\|^2 + \mu\|x\|^2, \text{with } \mu > 0$
*= can always be done, even when A is not wide.
* fails when A is not skinny.
* requires only that A is nonzero.

Suppose that $x$ minimizes $J_1(x) + \mu J_2(x)$,
for some value of $\mu > 0$, but you'd like to find a point with
a smaller value of $J_2$, if possible. You should
* decrease the parameter $\mu$ and minimize $J_1+\mu J_2$.
*= increase the parameter $\mu$ and minimize $J_1+\mu J_2$.
* minimize $J_1 + (1/\mu)J_2$.
* minimize $J_1 − \mu J_2$.
