== Matrices Applications
[Portfolio Analysis]
Suppose we have a matrix $A$ that records the prices of $m$ assets
over $n$ days. Let a single asset's prices over time are represented
by a row of $A$ (and conversely, a single day's prices over all
assets are represented a column of $A$).

What does $A_{ij}$ represent?
* The price of asset $j$ on day $i$
*= The price of asset $i$ on day $j$

What does it mean if column $k$ has the highest RMS value among
all columns?
* Asset $k$ has the best return over the time period
* Asset $k$ has the best overall performance over the time period
*= Day $k$ was the best overall day for all assets
* On day $k$, asset prices varied the most.

Suppose we have calculated the angles between various assets. Which pairs
of assets do you expect to have small angles (high cosine value)?
*= Coca-Cola and Pepsi
* Coca-Cola and Hewlett-Packard
*= Dell and Hewlett-Packard
* Coca-Cola and Chevron


[Population Dynamics]
Suppose we have a vector $x^{(t)} \in \mathbb{R}^{100}$
where $x^{(i)}_i$ represents
the number of people in the United States at year $t$
who are $i$ years old. Suppose
we have a matrix $A$ that roughly approximates $x^{(t+1)} = Ax^{(t)}$.
That is $A$ represents how the population distribution
at year $t$ depends on the
population distribution at year $t+1$.

What do we expect the population distribution to look like
100 years after year $t$?
* $(Ax^{(t)})$
* $(Ax^{(t)})^{100}$
* $(Ax^{(t)})^{-100}$
*= $(A^{100}x^{(t)})$
* $(A^{-100}x^{(t)})$

What does $A_{ij}$ roughly mean or measure?
* The number of people aged $i$ or $j$.
* The number of people aged $j-i$.
* How much the population of people aged $i$ at year $t$ affects
the population of people aged $j$ at year $t+1$.
*= How much the population of people aged $j$ at year $t$ affects
the population of people aged $i$ at year $t+1$.

Which do we expect to be negative?
* $A_{99,98}$
* $A_{24,25}$
* $A_{25,24}$
* $A_{1,25}$
* $A_{25,30}$

Which do we expect to be positive?
*= $A_{99,98}$
* $A_{24,25}$
*= $A_{25,24}$
*= $A_{1,25}$
* $A_{25,30}$

Among positive values, which value do we expect to be the greatest?
* $A_{99,98}$
* $A_{24,25}$
*= $A_{25,24}$
* $A_{1,25}$
* $A_{25,30}$
