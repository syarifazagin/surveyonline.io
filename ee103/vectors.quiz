== Vectors
[]
Suppose we have vectors $
a = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}\,,\quad
b = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 6 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}\,,\quad
c = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\,,\quad
d = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}
$

What is $a_3$?
* 1
* 3
*= 2

Can we evaluate $c$ + $\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 6 \end{bmatrix}$?
* Yes :: $c$ is a 3-vector while $d$ is a 2-vector.
*= No

Are $a$ and $b$ linearly independent?
* Yes :: $a = \frac{1}{2} b$, so $a$ and $b$ are not linearly independent.
*= No

Can $a$ be written as a linear combination of $c$ and $d$?
*= Yes
* No :: $a$ can be written as a linear combination of $c$ and $d$: $a = c + \frac{1}{2}e$

Are $b$, $c$, and $d$ linearly independent?
* Yes
*= No

What is the angle between $c$ and $d$?
* Acute
*= $90^{\circ}$
* Obtuse

Suppose we have a linear function $f(x) : \textbf{R}^3 \rightarrow \textbf{R}$.
If $f(a) = 5$, what is $f(b)$?
* -5
* 5
*= 10

Can we generalize the triangle inequality to three vectors? i. e.
Do we have $\|a + b + c\| \leq \|a\| + \|b\| + \|c\|$ for $a, b, c \in \textbf{R}^n$?
*= Yes :: $\|a + b + c\| \leq \|a + b\| + \|c\| \leq \|a\| + \|b\| + \|c\|$
* No

Suppose the vector $c \in \textbf{R}^n$ represents the daily earnings of a company
over a period of $n$ days. That is, on day $i$,
the company earned $c_i$ dollars, where a negative value of $c_i$ means that the
company lost $|c_i|$ dollars that day. What does $\textbf{1}^T c$ represent?
* The last day's earnings
* The average earnings over the $n$ days.
*= The net earnings over the $n$ days
* The difference between the first day's and last day's earnings.
